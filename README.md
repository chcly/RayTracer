# RayTracer

Is a small custom ray tracer for educational purposes that runs either on the CPU or GPU. The GPU implementation is written with CUDA. It provides a small code base to work with, and an area to experiment with different ray tracing techniques and optimization tactics. The primary goal is to strike a balance between quality and performance in real-time, as well as to understand the performance limitations of the ray tracing algorithm.


## File formats

Scene information is provided with [.bascii](https://github.com/CharlesCarley/bAscii) files. 

The [Viewer](https://github.com/CharlesCarley/RayTracer/tree/master/Samples/Viewer) in the Samples directory is the main entry point. It provides the means to load a file, specify a backend, and display a scene. 

## Example

This [link](Extras/Example.md) provides a usage example.
