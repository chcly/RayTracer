# Image

A very basic image IO utility library.

## Building

It uses cmake to generate its make files it and has the following external git repositories as dependencies.

+ [FreeImage](https://github.com/CharlesCarley/FreeImage)
+ [Utils](https://github.com/CharlesCarley/Utils)

The file [gitupdate.py](gitupdate.py) will clone the the dependencies and update the sub-modules to the head of the master branch.


It has been tested with CMake's VisualStudio and Unix Makefile generators.
